# Hi! Welcome to Anthony Hidajat's (mmakgeolli's) portfolio!

## Overview

This README will contain various updates of my portfolio as well as screenshots of what they would look like!

For the first iteration of my portfolio, I mainly focused on generic details of any online portfolio, while also adding my own personal touch!

## Main Goals

- My name, avatar, and links to my sections are clearly presented

- The links in my navigation section work correctly (scrolls to the correct section / goes to the correct website)

- The section about my work clearly shows all my projects

- The images of my projects, when clicked, brings the user to the project

- The pages resize according to the window size, in order to be viewable even on mobile devices
